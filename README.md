# hello-world

Hi I'm Wes, nice to meet you! I am somewhat new here and trying to get back into coding after doing IT work for the past few years. 

I have a B.S. in Computer Science. 

I love JRPGS, playing tennis, and watching football!

Have you heard of the hit MMO Final Fantasy XIV with a free trial through the first expansion up to lvl 60??

I am looking forward to reestablishing my programming skills and learning new ones. I am hoping that this will  open up new opportunities for my career. 

I will continue to update this README as appropriate along my journey.
